In order to get the system up you'll need to have installed:

* node.js

You can download node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once node.js is installed run the following command in your terminal.

    $npm install -g bower

This will install bower globally on your system.

In your terminal run these commands:

    1. $npm install
